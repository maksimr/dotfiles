/**
 * journal.ts — the record a workflow run leaves so a later run can skip work.
 *
 * ## What resume actually buys
 *
 * The documented iteration loop is "edit the persisted script and re-run it".
 * Without a journal that re-pays every agent from scratch, which for a 40-agent
 * audit is the entire cost of the run — to change one line of the last stage.
 * With one, the unchanged prefix comes back from disk and only the edit runs.
 *
 * ## Why a *prefix*, and not a lookup table
 *
 * Each entry is keyed by both its position in the run and a hash of everything
 * that decides what that agent does. A replay walks positions in order and
 * stops reusing at the first entry that does not match — every call from there
 * on runs live. Reusing later matches out of order would be reusing a result
 * produced under different upstream conditions: the same prompt at position 12
 * of a *different* run is not the same work, because what fed it changed.
 *
 * A failed agent is journaled as a failure and never replayed as one. Resuming
 * a run that died at agent 5 exists to retry agent 5, so the prefix ends there
 * and 5 onwards run live — the alternative would make a failure permanent.
 *
 * ## Runs that use `agent({ resume })`
 *
 * Those are not replayed at all. A replayed agent is text from a file, not a
 * live child, so there is no conversation in this run for a later `resume` to
 * continue — and the id map that would find one belongs to the run that did
 * the spawning. Rather than replay a prefix that strands the first `resume`
 * call, a journal carrying one declines the whole cache and the run pays in
 * full. Coarse on purpose: the alternative is tracking which label each entry
 * ran under and capping the prefix below the earliest one that gets resumed,
 * which is a second key concept for a case that costs one run.
 *
 * ## Ordering under concurrency
 *
 * Positions are assigned as calls arrive, and with `pipeline` that order
 * depends on which agent finished first. A replay usually reproduces it, since
 * cached calls answer in journal order, but it is not guaranteed. That is why
 * the key is checked as well as the position: a run that interleaves
 * differently loses cache hits, it never returns another agent's answer.
 *
 * The file is JSON Lines, appended as each agent settles, so a run that is
 * killed mid-flight still leaves everything it had finished.
