 * Keep a subagent's tool scope correct as extensions register tools over time.

 * Extensions may call `registerTool` long after load — pi-mcp from `session_start`,

 * snapshotted. `registerTool` writes into the very `extension.tools` maps this reads,
 * so `inScope()` sees late arrivals on the next call.
 *
 * Two enforcement points, because neither covers the whole picture:
 *
 *   - `turn_end` re-narrows the ACTIVE set. pi emits `turn_end` immediately before
 *     `prepareNextTurn` re-snapshots `agent.state.tools`, and session listeners run
 *     synchronously, so the narrow lands in time for turns 2..N.
 *   - `beforeToolCall` blocks out-of-scope calls. Turn 1 cannot be narrowed at all:
 *     `before_agent_start` fires INSIDE `prompt()` and may widen the tool set, but
 *     `createContextSnapshot()` freezes that turn's tools immediately after — there
 *     is no hook in between. A call-time check is the only correct guard there.
 *
 * Both are installed on the session and deliberately NOT unsubscribed: they must
 * outlive the `runAgent` call so resumed/steered turns stay scoped. pi's `dispose()`
 * clears `_eventListeners`, so they die with the session rather than leaking.
 *
 * Only meaningful when extensions are loaded — under `noExtensions`/`isolated` the
 * static `allowedToolNames` allowlist already gates the registry itself.

  // extension discovery orphans child processes on pi's non-agent code paths
  // (--help, config, trust probing).
  //

  // tool *registration* (`_refreshToolRegistry`'s `isAllowedTool`), not merely
  // the active set, and is frozen at construction — a name absent from the
  // snapshot is dropped forever, even once the tool actually registers (#125).
  //
  // Whenever extensions are in play we therefore:
  //   - leave `allowedToolNames` unset, so pi's live gate admits tools whenever
  //     they register;
  //   - express the name-stable, permanent part of the scope (our own

  //     `disallowedTools`) as `excludeTools`, which pi re-applies on every
  //     registry refresh;
  //   - enforce `ext:` narrowing on the ACTIVE set via the live `inScope()`
  //     predicate installed after bind — the active set is what the LLM sees,
  //     so a registry tool that is never activated is invisible and uncallable.
