 *
 * Opening an agent swaps the panes: that phase's agents move left and the
 * right becomes the agent's Prompt / Activity / Outcome detail.
 *
 * A phase with no agents yet shows its number and nothing else. The single-pane
 * layout this replaced spelled that out as "Not started yet"; the left pane is
 * too narrow to hold the words, and a numbered row with no count says it.
 *
 * **The glyphs are not the card's glyphs.** `workflow-card.ts` keys off the raw
 * entry `state`; this file keys off the *derived* `displayState(entry, active)`
 * and splits cases the card cannot see — skipped, blocked, queued and
 * interrupted all render as a plain ✘ or ⟳ inline but are distinct here. `◌`
 * (U+25CC) appears only in this file, and a running row animates a spinner where
 * the card draws a static `⟳`.
 *
 * **The phases pane is stranger still**: a phase that has not finished shows
 * *its number*, not a glyph. That is deliberate, recovered behaviour.
 *
 * **The layout is pure.** `layoutWorkflowDialog` returns coloured segments and
 * `handleWorkflowDialogKey` maps a keypress to the next state plus an optional
 * action; neither touches a theme, a terminal, or the workflow runtime. The
 * `WorkflowDialog` component is the thin shell that wires those to `ctx.ui`, and
 * the runtime side arrives as an injected `WorkflowDialogActions`.
 *
 * All state derivation lives in `src/workflow/progress.ts`; this file only
 * arranges what that module returns.
