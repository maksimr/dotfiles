 * workflow-menu.ts — `/agents → Workflows`, and the run inspector behind it.

 * The submenu and the overlay it opens live here, and everything they need arrives
 * as {@link WorkflowMenuDeps} rather than through a closure. The inspector is
 * reached from two places — this menu and a `workflow` row in the fleet list —
 * and both go through `showWorkflowDialog`, so the two entry points cannot
 * drift apart on what the keys do.
 *
 * Lives in the agents menu rather than as a top-level `/workflows` command: it
 * is one more view of the same fleet, and a second command name would only add
 * a collision surface (pi renames duplicate commands to `/workflows:1` and
 * `/workflows:2`, which breaks the bare name for both).
