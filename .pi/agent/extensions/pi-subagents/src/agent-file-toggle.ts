/**
 * agent-file-toggle.ts — Pure helpers for the `/agents` file-editing operations:
 * locating an agent's .md file and toggling its `enabled:` frontmatter flag.
 *
 * These live outside src/index.ts so they can be tested directly: the `/agents`
 * command handler is an ~890-line closure reached only through `registerCommand`,
 * which every test mocks.
 *
 * The read side of this data (src/custom-agents.ts) parses frontmatter with a
 * real YAML parser, so it honors `enabled: false` at any position in the block.
 * This module must agree with it, and splits the work accordingly:
 *
 * - Deciding whether a file is disabled is a *read*, so it calls that same parser
 *   (`isDisabledContent`) instead of mirroring it. A mirror has to be right about
 *   YAML's boolean spellings and about pi's fence scan, and a regex was wrong
 *   about both.
 * - *Editing* cannot go through the parser, because re-serializing a parsed
 *   document would reformat a file the README tells users to hand-author —
 *   discarding their comments, key order, and quoting. So the edits are line-wise
 *   and preserve everything they don't touch.
 *
 * That leaves removal best-effort: it recognizes a lowercase bare `false`, and
 * reports `changed: false` for the spellings it cannot rewrite, so the caller
 * refuses honestly rather than announcing a change it did not make.
