 * - "append" mode: parent system prompt + sub-agent context + env header + config.systemPrompt
 * - "append" with empty systemPrompt: pure parent clone
 *
 * Both modes include an `<active_agent name="${config.name}"/>` tag so downstream
 * extensions (e.g. permission/policy systems) can resolve per-agent policy
 * inside the child session by parsing the system prompt. In replace mode the tag
 * is prepended; in append mode it follows the shared inherited content so the
 * parent prompt forms an identical, cacheable byte prefix with the parent
 * session (the LLM's KV cache can then reuse those tokens across every spawn).
 *
 * @param parentSystemPrompt  The parent agent's effective system prompt (for append mode).
 * @param extras  Optional extra sections to inject (memory, preloaded skills).
